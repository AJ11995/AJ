Here we would be analysing the Titanic dataset and answer 20 basic questions in order to get some insights.

First we will read the titanic dataset:

```{r}
tg7 = read.csv("titanic_full.csv")
```

Let's go through the basic details of the dataset.

```{r}
#head and tail
head(tg7)
tail(tg7)

#number of column and rows
nrow(tg7)
ncol(tg7)

#basic structure
str(tg7)

```

As we can see, there are 1309 rows and 21 columns with their class type and first few okf the observations.
Also, we observe that there are many rows in which there is no data present. Therefore we will first check that.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(tg7))
```
